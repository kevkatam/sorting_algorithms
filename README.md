# sorting_algorithms
- Project done during the ALX fullstack software engineering program

## Aim was to learn about:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
